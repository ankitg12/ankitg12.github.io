**What is Deep Learning?**

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for decision making. It uses layers of algorithms, known as neural networks, which are trained on vast amounts of data. The term "deep" refers to the number of hidden layers in the neural network. Each layer transforms the input data in hopes that the final layer can provide an accurate prediction.

**Story 1: The Lion King Pingalaka**

Once upon a time, in a dense forest, a small lion cub named *Pingalaka* was born. Young and inexperienced, Pingalaka often found himself amidst threats, unsure of his actions. As he matured, he observed the world around him, learning from each interaction, each roar, and every hunt. The once naive cub slowly transformed into a *mighty lion*, earning the title of the 'King of the Jungle.' His secret was simple - learn from every experience, remember the consequences, and adjust his future actions accordingly.

**Explanation of Deep Learning through the story**

Pingalaka's journey mirrors the core principles of *Deep Learning* and *Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)*. When a neural network is initialized, it's akin to the cub Pingalaka, naive and untrained. It knows nothing about the data it is about to process.

As Pingalaka went through various experiences, he learned and evolved, becoming the *King*. Similarly, an ANN learns from the input data during a process known as *forward propagation*. In this phase, the network makes predictions based on the input data and its current weights and biases.

However, not all of Pingalaka's experiences were successful. He made mistakes, faced failures. But, it was his ability to learn from these experiences that made him a successful king. This principle is embodied in an ANN by the process of *backpropagation*. It's here that the network learns from its 'mistakes' by calculating the difference between its predicted output and the actual output. This 'error' is then propagated back through the network, adjusting the weights and biases along the way, helping it make more accurate predictions in the future.

In essence, the story of Pingalaka beautifully captures the fundamental workings of Deep Learning and ANNs. As we move forward, we'll delve into more complex structures and principles, using our friends from the Panchtantra tales.
